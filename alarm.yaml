alarm: automation.alarm_triggered
warning: automation.alarm_warning

##[CODE RELATED]
#[REQUIRED] Master Code, should consist of one or more digits ie '6482' ensure your passcode is encapsulated by quotes
code: !secret alarm_code 
#[OPTIONAL] Panic Code should consist of one or more digits ie '9876' ensure your passcode is encapsulated by quotes, it needs to be different to your standard alarm code. This enables a special panic mode. This can be used under duress to deactivate the alarm which would appear to the unseeing eye as deactivated however a special attribute [panic_mode] listed under the alarm_control_panel.[identifier] will change to ACTIVE. This status could be used in your automations to send a notification to someone else police/spouse/sibling/neighbour that you are under duress. To deactive this mode arm then disarm your alarm in the usual manner. 
panic_code: !secret panic_code 

#[DEFAULT] Grace time in seconds to allow for exit and entry using Away mode
pending_time: 45  
#[DEFAULT] The amount of time the alarm stays triggered before returning to its previous state
trigger_time: 300 

##[STATE RELATED]
#[OPTIONAL]
armed_perimeter: 
  ##[OPTIONAL however either an immediate or delayed group must exist] Sensors in this group tigger the alarm immediately 
  delayed:
    - cover.garage_door
    - sensor.front_door

#[REQUIRED]
armed_home: 
  #[OPTIONAL] State specific overrides default time above
  pending_time: 10
  #[OPTIONAL] State specific overrides default time above
  trigger_time: 300 
##[OPTIONAL] Sensors in this group start the clock (pending_time) when tripped before the alarm is triggered 
  delayed:
    - cover.garage_door
    - sensor.front_door

#[REQUIRED]
armed_away: 
  #[OPTIONAL] State specific overrides default time above
  trigger_time: 600  
  ##[OPTIONAL however either an immediate or delayed group must exist] Sensors in this group tigger the alarm immediately 
  immediate:
    - cover.garage_door
  ##[OPTIONAL] Sensors in this group start the clock (pending_time) when tripped before the alarm is triggered 
  delayed:
    - sensor.front_door

##[INTERFACE OPTIONAL SETTINGS] 
#[OPTIONAL] - False by default. True enables a clock in the center of the status bar
clock: True  
#[OPTIONAL] - False by default. True enables perimeter mode, this could be known as 'Day Mode' i.e. only arm the doors whilst there is someone using all floors
perimeter_mode: True 
#[OPTIONAL] - False by Default. Allows a weather summary to be displayed on the status bar. Dark Sky weather component must be enabled with the name sensor.dark_sky_summary
weather: True 
#[OPTIONAL] False by Default. Allows this custom component to save the state of the alarm to file then reinstate it in the event of power loss.
persistence: False 
#[OPTIONAL] - True by default. This is a security feature when enabled hides the passcode while entering disarm code.
hide_passcode: True 
#[OPTIONAL] - False by default. This is a security feature when enabled hides the HA sidebar when the alarm is armed. The sidebar re-appears when the alarm is disarmed.
hide_sidebar: True 
#[OPTIONAL] - False by default. Setting this to True hides sensor groups (all sensors, immediate sensors, delayed sensors, inactive sensors) from the display. Open sensors will still appear
hide_sensor_groups: False 
#[OPTIONAL] - True by default. Setting this to False enables a custom panel below the sensors groups which allows you to add your own html code. Use this to bring any other features you would like to see for example displaying live camera feeds, a rotating image gallery, custom HA buttons and sensors. To use this enable the custom panel in alarm.yaml (custom_panel: True) then ensure you take a copy of custom-element.html and add it to you www/alarm/ folder. Edit the html code between the <template> tags. I'm have added a custom sample folder where I will upload examples of 'things' which can be added here. Please contribute!!!
hide_custom_panel: True 

##[PASSCODE RELATED]
#[OPTIONAL] Disabled if commented out. When a value equal or greater than 0 is set, the system will only allow the set amount of password attempts before timing out
#passcode_attempts: 3 
#[OPTIONAL] Default 30 seconds. When set with the password attempts option the panel will timeout for the amount of seconds set if the password is entered incorrectly as per the password_attempts option. The system will then reset the allowed password attempts
#passcode_attempts_timeout: 30 

##[MQTT RELATED]
#[OPTIONAL] - False by default. Settings this to True will enable MQTT Mode. Uncomment options below to use See the README for guidance.
#mqtt: True 
#[OPTIONAL] False by default. if true allows MQTT commands to disarm the alarm without a valid code.
#override_code: True 
#[OPTIONAL] The MQTT topic HA will publish state updates to.
#state_topic: 'home/alarm' 
#[OPTIONAL] The MQTT topic HA will subscribe to, to receive commands from a remote device to change the alarm state.
#command_topic: 'home/alarm/set' 
#[OPTIONAL] The maximum QoS level for subscribing and publishing to MQTT messages. Default is 0.
#qos: 0 
#[OPTIONAL] The payload to disarm this Alarm Panel. Default is “DISARM”.
#payload_disarm: "DISARM" 
#[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-home mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_HOME”.
#payload_arm_home: "ARM_HOME" 
#[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-away mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_AWAY”.
#payload_arm_away: "ARM_AWAY" 
#[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-night mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_NIGHT”.
#payload_arm_night: "ARM_NIGHT" 

## [COLOURS] Use any HTML format
warning_colour: 'orange'
pending_colour: 'orange'
disarmed_colour: '#03A9F4'
armed_home_colour: 'black'
armed_away_colour: 'black'
triggered_colour: 'red'

## [CUSTOM SENSOR STATUSES]
## These settings allow devices which are not natively supported by this panel to be used. 
## This is to be used when the state of the device is not recognised by the panel. Examples are provided below 
#custom_supported_statuses_on:
#  - 'running' #EXAMPLE
#  - flipped #EXAMPLE
#custom_supported_statuses_off:
#  - 'not_running' #EXAMPLE
#  - unflipped   #EXAMPLE
